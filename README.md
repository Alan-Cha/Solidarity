Solidarity is an app and an API that creates safe spaces for you and your friends, requests assistance from nearby allies, and makes the world safer for everyone.

After Brexit in the UK, the presidential election in America, and a dozen other recent major world events, hate crimes have drastically increased to record rates. Ignorance, small-mindedness, and intolerance are bound to exist throughout the world but now, targeted groups feel an especially great need for safety and security. Minority groups are in the greatest danger because they are the smaller, weaker, and less influential sides of society

Our goal is to help these groups help themselves. We believe in safety in numbers and if we can create a system that will allow these like-minded people to quickly gather in times of danger, perpetrators of violence will feel discouraged from starting confrontations and targeted groups will more confident in less-than-ideal situations. This is the goal of Solidarity.
